Hint
An element x of an integer array arr of length m is dominant if more than half the elements of arr have a value of x.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n with one dominant element.

You can split nums at an index i into two arrays nums[0, ..., i] and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1], but the split is only valid if:

0 <= i < n - 1
nums[0, ..., i], and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] have the same dominant element.
Here, nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j, both ends being inclusive. Particularly, if j < i then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.

Return the minimum index of a valid split. If no valid split exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can split the array at index 2 to obtain arrays [1,2,2] and [2]. 
In array [1,2,2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs twice in the array and 2 * 2 > 3. 
In array [2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs once in the array and 1 * 2 > 1.
Both [1,2,2] and [2] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split. 
It can be shown that index 2 is the minimum index of a valid split. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,1,1,1,7,1,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can split the array at index 4 to obtain arrays [2,1,3,1,1] and [1,7,1,2,1].
In array [2,1,3,1,1], element 1 is dominant since it occurs thrice in the array and 3 * 2 > 5.
In array [1,7,1,2,1], element 1 is dominant since it occurs thrice in the array and 3 * 2 > 5.
Both [2,1,3,1,1] and [1,7,1,2,1] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split.
It can be shown that index 4 is the minimum index of a valid split.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,7,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that there is no valid split.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums has exactly one dominant element.

    ðŸ”¹ Approach:
    - Use two hash maps `mp1` and `mp2`. 
        - `mp1` will store the count of elements from the left part (up to index `i`).
        - `mp2` will store the count of elements from the right part (from index `i+1` onward).
    - For each element at index `i`, check if it appears more than half in both the left and right parts of the array.
        - Left part: `mp1[nums[i]] > n1 / 2`
        - Right part: `mp2[nums[i]] > n2 / 2`
    - If such an index is found, return the index `i`.

    ðŸ”¹ Intuition:
    - The goal is to find an index where the element at that index is the majority in both the left and right parts of the array.
    - We adjust the count of elements in both parts as we move through the array.

    ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:
    - **O(N)**, where `N` is the size of the array. We are iterating over the array twice (one to populate `mp2` and once to check conditions).
    
    ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity:
    - **O(N)** for storing the counts in hash maps.

/*
    ðŸ”¹ Approach:
    - **Step 1: Find the Majority Element using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.**
      - The majority element is the element that appears more than `n/2` times.
    - **Step 2: Count the occurrences of the majority element.**
      - Count how many times `majEle` appears in `nums`.
    - **Step 3: Iterate through the array to check for the minimum index.**
      - Maintain `cnt` (count of `majEle` in the left part) and `remCnt` (remaining count in the right part).
      - Check if `majEle` is dominant in both the left and right partitions.

    ðŸ”¹ Intuition:
    - The key observation is that if there exists an index `i` where the majority element remains dominant in both left and right partitions, that is our answer.
    - We leverage the **Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm** to efficiently find the majority element in O(N) time.

    ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:
    - **O(N)** since we traverse the array only a few times (finding majority element, counting, and checking dominance conditions).
    
    ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity:
    - **O(1)** since we use only a few extra variables.
