Hint
You are given the two integers, n and m and two integer arrays, hBars and vBars. The grid has n + 2 horizontal and m + 2 vertical bars, creating 1 x 1 unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from 1.

You can remove some of the bars in hBars from horizontal bars and some of the bars in vBars from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.

Return an integer denoting the maximum area of a square-shaped hole in the grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 2, m = 1, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The left image shows the initial grid formed by the bars. The horizontal bars are [1,2,3,4], and the vertical bars are [1,2,3].

One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.

Example 2:



Input: n = 1, m = 1, hBars = [2], vBars = [2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

To get the maximum square-shaped hole, we remove horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2.

Example 3:



Input: n = 2, m = 3, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2,4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

One way to get the maximum square-shaped hole is by removing horizontal bar 3, and vertical bar 4.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109
1 <= m <= 109
1 <= hBars.length <= 100
2 <= hBars[i] <= n + 1
1 <= vBars.length <= 100
2 <= vBars[i] <= m + 1
All values in hBars are distinct.
All values in vBars are distinct.

/*
Approach:
---------
A square hole is formed by removing consecutive horizontal and vertical bars.

Steps:
1. Sort the indices of removed horizontal bars and vertical bars.
2. Find the maximum number of consecutive removed bars in:
   - horizontal direction
   - vertical direction
3. If `k` consecutive bars are removed, the gap size becomes `k + 1`.
4. The largest possible square side is:
      min(maxHorizontalGap, maxVerticalGap)
5. Return the area of the square: side * side.

Intuition:
----------
Removing consecutive bars increases the continuous gap.
To form a square, both dimensions must support the same side length,
so we take the minimum of horizontal and vertical gaps.

Time Complexity:
----------------
O(H log H + V log V)
- Sorting horizontal and vertical bars

Space Complexity:
-----------------
O(1) (excluding input storage)
- Only constant extra variables are used
