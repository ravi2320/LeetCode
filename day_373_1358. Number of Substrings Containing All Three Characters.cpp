Hint
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

/**
 * Approach:
 * - Use a **sliding window** with two pointers (`i` and `j`).
 * - Maintain a **frequency array `freq[3]`** for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
 * - Expand `j` to include characters until all three ('a', 'b', 'c') are present.
 * - Shrink `i` while the condition holds, and **count valid substrings**.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ **Time Complexity**: O(N) â†’ Two-pointer traversal.
 * ðŸ”¹ **Space Complexity**: O(1) â†’ Fixed size frequency array (3 elements).
