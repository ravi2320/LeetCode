Hint
On day 1, one person discovers a secret.

You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6, delay = 2, forget = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
Day 1: Suppose the first person is named A. (1 person)
Day 2: A is the only person who knows the secret. (1 person)
Day 3: A shares the secret with a new person, B. (2 people)
Day 4: A shares the secret with a new person, C. (3 people)
Day 5: A forgets the secret, and B shares the secret with a new person, D. (3 people)
Day 6: B shares the secret with E, and C shares the secret with F. (5 people)
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, delay = 1, forget = 3
Output: 6
Explanation:
Day 1: The first person is named A. (1 person)
Day 2: A shares the secret with B. (2 people)
Day 3: A and B share the secret with 2 new people, C and D. (4 people)
Day 4: A forgets the secret. B, C, and D share the secret with 3 new people. (6 people)
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 1000
1 <= delay < forget <= n

/*
Approach:
1. Use recursion with memoization (Top-Down DP).
   - Define `solve(day, delay, forget)` as the number of people who first learn the secret on `day`.
   - Base case: On `day = 1`, one person initially knows the secret.
   - Transition: On `day`, the person could have learned it from some `prev` day.
     - They can only share after `delay` days.
     - They forget after `forget` days.
     - So valid `prev` days lie in the interval [day - forget + 1, day - delay].
   - Sum contributions from all valid `prev` days.

2. In `peopleAwareOfSecret`, calculate how many still remember the secret on the last day `n`.
   - Loop from `n - forget + 1` to `n` because these people have not forgotten yet.

Intuition:
- Each person starts sharing only after `delay` days and stops after `forget` days.
- Using DP avoids recalculating overlapping subproblems since the same "day" can be reached via multiple paths.
- Final answer = sum of all people who still remember the secret on day `n`.

Time Complexity: O(n * forget)  
- For each `day`, we may iterate over at most `forget` previous days.

Space Complexity: O(n)  
- Memoization array `dp` of size `n+1`.

            if(prev > 0) {
                res = (res + solve(prev, delay, forget)) % M;
