You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

 

Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:

Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

 

Constraints:

1 <= tasks.length <= 104
tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
0 <= n <= 100

// Approach:
// - We first count the frequency of each task using a frequency map.
// - We then push the frequencies into a max heap (priority_queue) to process tasks with the highest frequency first.
// - We iterate through the tasks, processing them in chunks of (n+1) tasks, where n is the cooldown period.
// - For each chunk, we pop tasks from the priority queue, decrement their frequencies, and add them back if they still have remaining tasks.
// - If the priority queue becomes empty during processing, we add the remaining tasks in the current chunk to the total time.
// - Otherwise, we add the entire cooldown period (n+1) to the total time for the next iteration.
// - Finally, we return the total time taken to complete all tasks.
