Hint
You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

 

Example 1:


Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
Example 2:

Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= events.length <= 105
events[i].length == 2
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 105

/*
Approach:
- Each event is represented by a pair [startDay, endDay].
- We aim to attend as many events as possible, where only one event can be attended per day.
- Sort all events by start day.
- Use a min-heap (priority queue) to store end days of ongoing events.
- For each day, push all events that start that day into the heap.
- Attend the event that ends the earliest (i.e., top of min-heap).
- Remove expired events (whose end day < current day).
- Repeat until all events are processed or heap is empty.

Intuition:
- Attend events that are going to end soonest (greedy approach).
- Using a min-heap helps efficiently track the event that will end earliest.

Time Complexity:
- O(N log N + D log N), where:
  - N = number of events
  - D = range of days we need to process
- Sorting events takes O(N log N).
- Each event is inserted and removed from the heap once â†’ O(N log N) heap operations.

Space Complexity:
- O(N) for the heap and sorted event storage.
