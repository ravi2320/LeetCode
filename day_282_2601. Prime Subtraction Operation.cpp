Hint
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:

Pick an index i that you havenâ€™t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.

A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10].
In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].
After the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,8,11,12]
Output: true
Explanation: Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't need to make any operations.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,8,3]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums.length == n

Approach:
1. Generate a sieve of primes up to 1000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Traverse the array `nums` from right to left (starting from the second last element).
   - If `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`, skip to the next element.
   - Otherwise, try subtracting each prime (smaller than `nums[i]`) from `nums[i]` to make `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`.
   - If successful, break out of the inner loop and move to the next element.
3. If `nums[i]` is still not smaller than `nums[i+1]` after trying all primes, return `false`.
4. If we complete the loop without returning `false`, return `true`.

Time Complexity:
- Sieve generation: O(N log log N), where N = 1000.
- Checking conditions and updating `nums`: O(n * p), where `n` is the length of `nums` and `p` is the number of primes.

Space Complexity: O(N) for storing the sieve and additional O(n) space for `nums`.
