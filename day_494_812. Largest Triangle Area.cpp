Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0.50000
 

Constraints:

3 <= points.length <= 50
-50 <= xi, yi <= 50
All the given points are unique.

Approach:
1. The area of a triangle given 3 points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) can be found using the
   Shoelace formula:
      Area = |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)| / 2
2. Iterate over all triplets of points (brute force).
3. Compute the area for each triplet using the formula and update the maximum area.
4. Return the maximum area found.

Intuition:
- Any 3 points in 2D space form a triangle (unless collinear).
- To maximize the area, we must check all combinations.
- Shoelace formula gives a direct O(1) way to compute the triangleâ€™s area.

Time Complexity:
- O(n^3), since we check all possible triplets of points.
Space Complexity:
- O(1), only a few variables are used.

                    // Compute area using Shoelace formula
                    double area = abs(x1 * (y2 - y3) +
                                      x2 * (y3 - y1) +
